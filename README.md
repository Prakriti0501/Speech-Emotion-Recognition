# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
The goal of this project is to teach a computer to understand and recognize human emotions from the sound of someone's voice. For example, the computer should be able to tell if a person sounds happy, sad, or any other emotion, just by listening to their voice.This loads an emotional speech dataset, preprocesses the audio data, creates a neural network model particularly utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and trains it for emotion classification. The provided functions and visualizations help in understanding the characteristics of the audio data and the training process of the model.
